CONTRACT APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

SnailsToken is an ERC721 contract, where snail tokens can be minted.  Each token represents a snail.

INITIAL MINTING:
MintSnailsTo() - This function allows the contrct owner to mints new snail tokens to any address (account).
When a new snail is minted it includes a record of its parents (mumId and dadId) and its generation.  Typically  
new snails that are minted using this function directly have unknown parants (with mumId & dadId both set to 0)
and the snail's generation is set to 0 (see 'Generations' below.)

BREEDING SNAILS:
Snails are hamaphropdites (ie. are both male & female) and so upon mating either may be fertilised/conceive and
give birth to a one new snail).
Specificaly two snail tokens may be mated together using the breed() function, with a pseudo-random chance that 
each snail gives birth to new snail token.  Therefore upon two snails breeding, either 0, 1, or 2 new snails are 
born (minted) - ie. there are 4 possible outcomes from a call to breed(snailA, snailB):
 1. Neither snail conceives - no new snails are minted
 2. Only snail mateA conceives - 1x new snail are minted
 3. Only snail mateB conceives - 1x new snail are minted
 4. Both snail mate A & B conceive - 2x new snails are minted

The parents of a newly minted Snail are known & stored (ie. the new snail's 'mum' & 'dad').

Generation: Each snail token has a generation (Gen).  When two snails breed then any new snails 
that are born will be of a later generation, eg. 2x Gen-0 snails breed to produce Gen-1 snails.

THE ISSUE - Pseudo-randomness used in breed function (that determines what further ERC721 tokens are minted)
1.  The breed() function sometimes executes the first time it is called but other times it fails upon first call. On subsequent calls breed() reverts (for an unknown reason).
2.  This breed() revert seems to be due to breed's pseudo-random outcome - ie. either 0, 1, or 2 new ERC721 snail token may be minted.
3.  Why does this revert occurs and why it sometime complete sucessfully?  I've coded similar breed-like test functions that always creates 0, 1 or 2 new snails (ie. a fixed number of new tokens minted) and all work correctly. 
Hence I think that I've proved that the issue is related to the pseudo-randomness of minting new (ERC721) tokens during the execution of breed. These breed-like test functions (that give fixed non-random results) are:
      i.   breedBothMatesFertilised(snailA, snailB)  
      ii.  breedMateAFertilised(snailA, snailB) 
      iii. breedMateBFertilised(snailA, snailB) 
    They always sucessfully produce a specific number of newly minted snails, proven by Truffle tests in:
      i.   04.snailToken_breedBothMatesFertilised_test.js
      ii.  05.snailToken_breedMateAFertilised_test.js
      iii. 06.snailToken_breedMateBFertilised_test.js
    Note: These Tests are refactored copies of the breed() truffle test (02_snailToken_breed_test.js).

    Similarly I created another test function breedToConceiveOnly(snailA, snailB) that breeds two snails to produce a
    pseudo-random fertilisation/conception result (as does the breed() function) but then ends without minting any snails. It has an associated test script 03.snailToken_breedToConceiveOnly_test.js
    This function / test script always passes and hence also always functions as expected.

    Bottom line: All of these test functions/test-scripts function as expected.  And hence I've checked the discrete parts of code (employed by breed) and all function as expected.  The issue therefore is when breed() itself is executed that uses all these steps together - ie. pseudo-randomly determines which of the two snails conceive and then mints the appropraite number of newly conceived snail tokens.  

    TEST RUN OUTPUT (Executing just these 4 truffle test files)

    Note: Under test "should allow suitable mates to breedToConceiveOnly" that for each of 3x calls the fertilisation/conceptions occur pseudo-randonly and hence typically give different conceptions for each run.

TESTING - HITTING THE ISSUE (WITH TEST FAILURES)
The Truffle Test file that shows the breed() issue (ie. tests fail that I'd expect to pass) is 0.2.snailToken_breed_test.js
Note That the first call to breed "should allow suitable mates to breed" (under Breed Two Snails (with pseudo-random...") sometimes executes sucessfully and at other times doesn't.  The following test "should get expected (pseudo-random) fertilisation from each breed (test for 3x breeds)"" (irrespective of first test result) always fails.

Here are some example Truffle test runs. 
Before each test run I restart ganache:
  ganache -h 127.0.0.1 -p 8545 -m "quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" --miner.timestampIncrement 1

         should get expected (pseudo-random) conception result from each breed (test for 3x breeds):
     Transaction: 0x6c508d9bc7fc890517018345ccfb0046fe331045cda4cb99eb9c36021c7dbfc7 exited with an error (status 0) after consuming all gas.
     Please check that the transaction:
     - satisfies all conditions set by Solidity `assert` statements.
     - has enough gas to execute the full transaction.
     - does not trigger an invalid opcode by other means (ex: accessing an array out of bounds).

Third Run of Test Script: First call to breed() succeeds (under " should allow suitable mates to breed ")
                        Suceeds (A case where mate B only is fertilised/conceives) and then fails for 2nd & 3rd calls
                        (test "should get expected (pseudo-random) fertilisation from each breed (test for 3x breeds)")
                        But subquent breed calls revert but call to breed() under "should allow breed after 'paused' SnailToken contract is 'unpaused'" works.

  Contract: 02 SnailToken - Two snails breed
    Breed Snails: Both mates must be present
      ✓ should NOT allow breed if neither mate is present (owned/approved)
      ✓ should NOT allow breed if only one mate is present (owned/approved) (60ms)
      ✓ should NOT allow a snail to be breed with itself
    Breed Two Snails (with pseudo-random chance that each mate produces 1x newborn smail): 
      ✓ should allow suitable mates to breed (62ms)
        1. Actual fertilisation result, mate A: false; mate B: true
        1. Expect fertilisation result, mate A: false; mate B: true
      1) should get expected (pseudo-random) fertilisation from each breed (test for 3x breeds)
    > No events were emitted
        Breed 1: 1x conceptions - mateB only
      2) should get expected (pseudo-random) conception result from each breed (test for 3x breeds)
    > No events were emitted
        Expected only mateB to have a baby snail...
      ✓ should when there are new-born snails (from breeding), emit a 'SnailsBorn' event (65ms)
      ✓ should, after breed indicates new-born snail(s), have minted the expected new snails (73ms)
      ✓ should have (for any) new-born snails have the correct parents identified (95ms)
    Snail Breeding: Pausing  & Unpausing the SnailToken Contract
      ✓ should NOT breed when SnailToken contract is in 'paused' state (44ms)
      ✓ should allow breed after 'paused' SnailToken contract is 'unpaused' (110ms)
